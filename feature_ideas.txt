•⁠  ⁠Voice agents for each developer where it will take updates weekly and ask questions on projects and problems faced - Agent to manage workload between all developers, so that there’s maximum utilization of workforce - We dont just need present insights, recommendations should be given to developers/HRs, for what they should do further - Once developers make commits to projects, mails should be sent to non tech roles as well telling what exactly is the project progress
